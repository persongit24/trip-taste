# Privacy Policy for Trip & Taste Family Hub

Effective Date: September 2025

	•	Access is protected by an invite code. This code is managed privately by your family.
	•	The App uses standard iOS system services (e.g., WebKit, navigation, refresh).
	•	Any data you enter or view comes directly from the third-party web apps you open within the App.

How Your Information Is Used
	•	The App does not analyze, share, or sell data.
	•	The web apps you open may have their own privacy policies, which apply when you use them.

Data Sharing
	•	The App does not share information with third parties.
	•	Apple may collect diagnostic data (e.g., crash logs) as part of iOS system services.

Children’s Privacy

	•	No personal information is collected from children.

Security
	•	Access requires a family invite code, which you control.
